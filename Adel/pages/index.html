    <h4><u>Scottish Straight Breed History:</u></h4>
    <div>
        
        
        <p><i><small>This breed of cat has an interesting history. The very first Scottish Fold was a barn cat whose name was Susie. She was found by William Ross in 1961 in Scotland, on a farm near Coupar Angus in Perthshire. He quickly recognized that she had a standout feature: folded ears that made her look a bit like an owl. This kitty was later bred with other breeds, such as the American Shorthair, Burmese, Exotic Shorthair, and Persian.</small></i></p>
        
        <p><i><small>One important thing to realize is that the Scottish Straight is almost identical to the Scottish Fold, and they can actually be born within the same litter. The only difference is in the ears. While Scottish Folds have those iconic ears that fold down, Scottish Straight cats do not. As the name implies, their ears are straight like other breeds. The reason for this difference lies in the breed’s origins. All Scottish Folds can trace their ancestry back to that first kitty with folded ears, Susie. However, the selective breeding program did not solely produce kittens with those unique ears, as some had straight ears. Thus, all Scottish Folds that do not develop the unusual folded ears are simply called Scottish Straights. So, when you learn about the Scottish Fold, you’re also learning about the Scottish Straight, and vice versa. Again, they can both be born in the same litter, and will, therefore, showcase the same personality traits and physical attributes.</small></i></p>
